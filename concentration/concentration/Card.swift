//difference between struct and class
//1. no inheritance in structs
//2. structs are value types. classes are reference types
//structs get free initialiser to initialise all vars

//we won't have the emoji type here because that is the view component and this is the model.

//static methods and variables are associated with the class and not the objects. they are universal to the class.
